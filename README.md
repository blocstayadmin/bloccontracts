Smart Contracts for the BlocStay Network

Welcome to our BlocContracts set of smart contracts compliant with ERC-20 standards!

We have a library and 12 separate contracts, including four independently deployable contracts which function as:

1.  A multi-signature repository for all ETH payments after escrow is released
2.  An escrow account that holds all ETH payments until we hit our soft cap goals for both pre-ICO and ICO
3.  A lock-up account that holds all INN tokens until the end of the ICO and, for internal team, for a set period prior to release to protect purchasers.
4.  A production contract that handles all production of our tokens pursuant to our Whitepaper.
